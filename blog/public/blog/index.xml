      <description>Ok, so I hate it when people tell me what I should be doing too, but in this case, I am going to make an exception. Of course, this is just my opinion, but you should be using &amp;lsquo;Azure User Voice&amp;rsquo;
What is Azure User Voice? User Voice is one of the ways Microsoft gets feedback about their products and suggestions around features and changes. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a Microsoft employee or an MVP, you can just go to the site and type in a suggestion.</description>

      <description>Every blog has to have a first post right. Well this is mine.
The plan is to detail how I have put this blog together with Azure DevOps. That will have to come in a later post because there a good amount of detail to document. I have over complicated it as a learning process (WordPress is just too easy). I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can complicate it some more, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s working and I have a space to write now.</description>
