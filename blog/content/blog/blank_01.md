## Installing Hugo on a Windows Machine

The first thing is to make sure you have Chocolatey Installed.  I know if is a little off topic, but it makes it so easy to install Hugo that it's worth doing. Take a look at [this page](https://chocolatey.org/install) if you are having issues or want to learn more.

To do this run the following line in an evelated PowerShell prompt:


```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
