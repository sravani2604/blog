Every blog has to have a first post right. Well this is mine.

The plan is to detail how I have put this blog together with Azure DevOps.  That will have to come in a later post because there a good amount of detail to document.  I have over complicated it as a learning process (WordPress is just too easy).  I'm sure I can complicate it some more, but for now it's working and I have a space to write now.

So that's it, this is the first post, but hopefully there will be more good stuff to come.  Feel free to contact me via the links on this page.

Watch this space......
