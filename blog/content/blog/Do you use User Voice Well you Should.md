Ok, so I hate it when people tell me what I should be doing too, but in this case, I am going to make an exception.  Of course, this is just my opinion, but you should be using 'Azure User Voice'

#### What is Azure User Voice?

User Voice is one of the ways Microsoft gets feedback about their products and suggestions around features and changes.  You don't have to be a Microsoft employee or an MVP, you can just go to the site and type in a suggestion.

#### How do I Participate?

Go take a look at https://feedback.azure.com and click on the topics (on the right) that you are interested in and get suggesting.  You are allocated a certain amount of votes that you can apply, it looks like have a total of 10, so only vote for the issues you are concerned with.  Once the issue is closed/implemented, then you will get your vote allocation back.

Once you have added your vote to an issue, take a look through the comments and notes on the topic.  You will often find notes from the product managers and developers about what is going on with the feature.  Sometimes there is a good reason why the suggestion can't be implemented, but they are pretty good at explaining why this is or how it is being fixed somewhere else etc.  Of course, it's not a guarantee that your feature/suggestion will instantly appear in the portal or product, but it's a great way to start the conversation with the people who are building the products.

In short, go to [Azure User Voice](https://feedback.azure.com) and get suggesting (and fixing) the issues and features that matter to you!
